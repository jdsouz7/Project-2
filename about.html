<p>My name is Jason D'Souza, and I was born in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>I moved to Chicago with my family back in 1999 and have been living here ever since.</p>
<p>As of now, I am a transfer student majoring in ITM, already having a business degree from UIC</p>
<p>I have always loved technology and am fascinated by its rapid growth, and am excited to see how it will change the world for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I love to travel, and have had the opportunity to go to cities such as London and Dubai, as well as visiting my parents' country of origin, India.</p>
<p>I hope to travel to more places and gain a wider world view, and experience different kinds of cultures.</p>
<p>I love listening to various different genres of music, as well as researching technology trends and studying stock market trends.</p>
